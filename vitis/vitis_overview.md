# Vitis Tutorials Overview

* Here you can find tutorials for the Xilinx Vitis tool. For each tutorial you will find a documentation and the source codes and scripts (for each tutorial in a folder `reference_files`). The tutorials are targeted to the Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit. 
* For the tutorials you will need a so-called _Extensible Platform_. This platform is used in Vitis to link the IP kernels to a custom-built FPGA design for the _Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC_. The extensible platform provides everything what is needed in order to integrate and use the IP kernels designed in the tutorials. We provide our own custom-built platform which you can download as a zip-file [here](../vitis/resources/extensible_platform/kv260_platform.zip). 

* The Vitis tool version used is 2024.1. We assume that you have an installation on a Linux computer running Ubuntu 22.04.
